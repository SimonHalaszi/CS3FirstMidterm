Pushing to front and back is constant time
d.push_front(10); 
d.push_back(10); 
Constant time access d[0]: 10
Adding a bunch of elements to d 
Pushing with front and back, constant time
Printing elements in d with constant time access
d: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 10 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
std::deque<int>::iterator it = d.begin();
it += 5; // Iterator arithmetic. More on this later
d.erase(it);
Erasing element at the 5th index of d; O(N) operation
Printing elements in d with constant time access
